# CðŸ¦ VID-19 Tracker

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/fda0ea2e-e0f2-4fdd-a14c-dfce5a36bd22/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/covid19trackermrpb/deploys)

I had to rebuild this tracker, the API I was using was out dated. So I decided to rebuil this from React to Vue.js, which I am finding much more enjoyable to use at the moment.

This tracker displays Global figures and then figurs by countries.
